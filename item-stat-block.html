        <p><b>Price</b> 14,000 gp; <b>Aura</b> faint evocation and illusion; <b>CL</b> 3rd; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>
        <p>This shining white cloak is trimmed with golden sunbursts and continuously radiates light (as per the <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/light.html#light" >light</a> </i>spell, but only in a 10-foot radius). Twice per day, the wearer can command the cape to erupt in a burst of light, blinding all creatures other than the wearer within 20 feet for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 14 negates). After triggering this burst, the wearer becomes invisible (as the <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/invisibility.html#invisibility" >invisibility</a></i> spell, with a duration of 1 minute) and the cape's light is extinguished as long as the wearer is invisible.</p>

        <p>This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its owner takes. As a swift action, the wearer can order the cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the wearer concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the cloak, whichever comes first. When the field is used, all magic is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane silvery garment.</p>

        <p>This silvery gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it.

        <p>This thick leather cloak is charred and blackened around the edges and smells faintly of soot. Once per day, when subject to an effect that deals fire damage, the wearer can spend an immediate action while obscured by the flames to become invisible, leaving behind an illusory pile of ashes and bones, as if he had been slain by the fire effect.

        <p>This plain cloak only has any effect when worn by a member of a half-human race, such as a half-orc or half-elf. It alters the wearer's appearance similarly to a <i>hat of disguise</i>, but only to the extent that it conceals or alters the wearer's non-human physical traits so the creature appears fully human. Any feature that is plausibly human remains. For example, a half-orc wearing the cloak loses his green or gray skin color and pointed ears, has no visible tusks, and is otherwise completely able to pass as a human version of his normal self. Likewise, a half-elf wearing the cloak has round ears, humanlike eyes, and no other traits indicating elven ancestry. The wearer has no control over the specific guise, and those familiar with his normal appearance can recognize him in his human guise.</p>
